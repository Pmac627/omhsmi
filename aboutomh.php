				<span itemprop="description"><strong>The Origin of "Our Mission House" formerly known as "My Mission House"</strong><br /><br />
				<span itemprop="founder">Bishop Louis LaRavoire Morrow, SDB</span>, our Father Founder and author of the catechetical publications of "Our Mission House", was born on December 24, 1892 at Weatherford, Texas, USA. Later, the family moved to Mexico for business reasons. There, inspired by the happy fellowship of the Salesians of Saint John Bosco, he joined them in 1911, and was ordained priest on May 21, 1921 in Puebla, Mexico. There he founded "<em>La Buena Prensa</em>" (The Good Press) to promote wholesome literature and cinema.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				From 1922 to 1939 he served as secretary to Archbishop William Piani, Apostolic Delegate in Manila, Philippines. In 1926 he founded the <em>Catholic Truth Society, Manila</em> to publish Catholic literature, mainly for youth. This led him to author and publish some 25 religious books and booklets, and also nine text books officially recognized for use in schools. His esteemed religious book is <strong><em>My Catholic Faith</em></strong> later entitled <strong><em>Our Catholic Faith</em></strong>.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Some of his books have been translated worldwide into more than forty languages and dialects, with millions of copies circulated. His popular booklet "<strong>Questions on Vocation</strong>" boosted vocations in the Philippines.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				In 1939 he was ordained Bishop of Krishnagar, India by Pope Pius XII. Krishnagar is about 60 miles north of Calcutta. He extended his literary contribution to the USA, India and other countries. He established a center at Kenosha, Wisconsin under the title <em>My Mission House</em> for the distribution of his publications and to support his poor mission in India. He entrusted the responsibility of his publications to a team of his faithful lay collaborators of different faiths.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				As a great catechist and zealous missionary he founded our congregation of the Catechist Sisters of Mary Immaculate (SMI) on <span itemprop="foundingDate">December 12, 1948</span> for the purpose of evangelization and catechesis.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				He was Bishop of Krishnagar for 30 years during which he built up the diocese as well as rendered great services to the city of Krishnagar. For twelve years he was commissioner of Krishnagar Municipality. He served as official visitor to Nadia District Jail and Government Hospital, as well as consultant of the Indian Red Cross Society. He was an active and effective council father at Vatican II.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				After retirement from the diocese he continued revising his books and distributing the Bible in different languages. He was an ardent advocate of women's rights to bring justice and peace in the world. He was called to his eternal reward on August 31st, 1987.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				In the Great jubilee Year 2000 My Mission House was shifted from Kenosha to its present location at Leechburg, under the title "<strong>Our Mission House</strong>". Ever since, we, the Sisters of Mary Immaculate of Bishop Morrow, are carrying on the catechetical charism our Founder has bequeathed to us. The proceeds from <em>Our Mission House Publications</em> benefit our mission in India and Africa.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				Thank you and may God bless you for being part of our mission "To Love God and help others to Love God" through the purchase of our books.</span>
